## Project Overview
MultiAi is a SaaS web app providing a multi-LLM consensus dashboard — better answers through structured AI agent collaboration. Users view, manage, and interact with a live debate between AI agents. Authentication is not yet implemented.

The debate UX is a **Slack-style chatroom** (`ChatroomDebateView`). Each agent has a distinct avatar and name; they post messages into a single scrollable feed as the debate progresses. Round boundaries appear as channel dividers. The Scorer posts like a status-update bot. Typing indicators appear between messages. The final answer is pinned at the top of the channel — permanently visible. This layout scales naturally to any number of team members.

## Commands

Run all commands from the project root (`MultiAi`).

### Backend
```bash
uv run uvicorn backend.api.app:app --reload --port 8000
```

### Frontend
```bash
cd frontend && npm install
npm run dev        # Dev server at http://localhost:5173
npm run build      # tsc + vite build
npm test           # vitest run
```

### Python Tests
```bash
uv run pytest tests/                          # All tests
uv run pytest tests/test_scorer.py            # Single test file
uv run pytest tests/test_scorer.py::test_name # Single test
```

### uv setup (first time only)
```bash
winget install astral-sh.uv   # install uv (PowerShell)
uv pip install -r backend/requirements.txt  # install Python deps into .venv
```
Note: Python deps are in `backend/requirements.txt` (no version pins). There is no `pyproject.toml`. Use `uv pip install -r` rather than `uv sync`.

## Architecture

MultiAi is a multi-LLM consensus engine. 
The user poses a question; 
a Writer LLM answers it, two Critic LLMs critique it, and the loop continues until a Scorer (always Deepseek v3.2) rates agreement ≥ the configured threshold or max rounds is reached. 
A Summarizer (always Deepseek v3.2) compresses each round into a rolling context used in subsequent rounds. All LLM calls go through OpenRouter.

### Debate loop flow

```
POST /api/consult-stream
  → Attachments normalized (text extracted; images checked — Deepseek seats swapped to Gemini Flash if image input detected)
  → Intent assessed — returns clarification state if question is too ambiguous
  → ConsensusEngine.run()
    → Round 1: Writer(s) answer fresh (parallel if N writers)
    → Loop:
        Critics critique in parallel (use rolling_context, not full transcript)
        Scorer rates 1–10 (Deepseek v3.2 only, 600-char excerpts)
        Summarizer compresses round → appended to rolling_context (Deepseek v3.2, max_tokens=200)
        If score >= threshold → break
        Writer refines answer
        Relevance validation: refined answer checked against original question
    → Writer synthesizes final answer
  → Session saved as sessions/YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json
```

### Context management rule (critical)
Rolling context is **append-only summaries**, never full transcripts:
```python
rolling_context += f"\n[Round {round_num} summary]: {round_summary}"
```
This string — not the full answer/critique text — is passed to LLMs in subsequent rounds.

### Model routing
- Writers and Critics: user-selected from UI (N writers and N critics supported — see below)
- Scorer: always `deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.2`
- Summarizer: always `deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.2`
- Never route scorer/summarizer to user-selected models

### N-writer / N-critic support (implemented)
The engine accepts `writers: list[str]` and `critics: list[str]` (1–6 each). Behavior:
- **N writers:** All draft in parallel in round 1; their answers are merged and labeled `[Writer 1]`, `[Writer 2]`, etc. The primary writer (first) handles all refinements and final synthesis.
- **N critics:** All critique in parallel every round. Critiques are merged and labeled. Consensus score is the average of all pairwise scores across critics' revised answers. Single-critic sessions compare the writer's answer directly against the critic's suggestion.
- **Frontend:** `mergeTeamIntoPayload` sends `writers` and `critics` as full lists. Legacy `writer`/`critic_a`/`critic_b` fields are also sent for backward compat; the backend prefers the list fields.
- **Cap:** max 6 writers, max 6 critics (enforced in `schemas.py`).

## Coding standards

**Python**
- Python 3.11+: type hints on all function signatures, dataclasses for models
- All constants and limits defined in `config.py` — no magic numbers
- All file paths use `pathlib.Path`
- `ConsensusEngine` takes `config` as constructor arg — no `os.environ` inside methods
- Session store functions are stateless — accept `sessions_dir` as parameter
- LLM clients are module-level singletons (lazy init) — the only allowed global state
- Return `DebateSession` or `DebateRound` from engine functions — never raw dicts
- Logging via `logging` module only (never `print()`): INFO for completions, WARNING for parse failures/budget exceeded, ERROR for API/IO failures

**Frontend**
- **Tailwind CSS v4** — uses `@import "tailwindcss"`, `@theme inline`, `@variant dark`. Not v3. Do not follow v3 config docs.
- **Routing: React Router v6** (`react-router-dom`). Routes: `/app/new` (empty compose), `/app/run/:id` (session view), `/shared/:slug` (public stub, v4.2). Navigate with `useNavigate`. Read URL params with `useParams`. Do not add SSR, file-based routing, or a second router without instruction.
- **No global state library** — state is held in custom hooks called from `App.tsx`. Do not add Redux, Zustand, Jotai, etc. without explicit instruction.
- Path alias `@` → `frontend/src/` (configured in both `vite.config.ts` and `tsconfig.json` — keep in sync if changed).
- Dark mode is class-based: `.dark` toggled on `<html>` by `useDarkMode` hook.

## Prompt templates

Do not modify scorer, summarizer, or debate prompt templates without explicit instruction — wording changes affect consensus behavior. Templates live in `backend/consensus/prompts.py`.

## Testing

- All tests mock LLM calls — never make live API calls in tests
- Use `pytest-mock` and `tmp_path` fixture for session storage tests
- Token budget: warn if any session exceeds 12,000 tokens total

## Token budget

| Call | Target |
|------|--------|
| Round 1 answer / critique / refinement / synthesis | ≤ 800 tokens each |
| Summarizer | ≤ 200 tokens (`max_tokens=200` enforced) |
| Scorer | ≤ 100 tokens (600-char excerpts only) |

## Environment variables

All secrets in `.env` (gitignored):
```
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=
OPENROUTER_BASE_URL=https://openrouter.ai/api/v1
DEFAULT_WRITER_MODEL=openai/gpt-5.4
DEFAULT_CRITIC_MODEL_A=anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.6
DEFAULT_CRITIC_MODEL_B=google/gemini-3.1-pro
SCORER_MODEL=deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.2
SUMMARIZER_MODEL=deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.2
```

## What NOT to do

- Do not pass full round transcripts to subsequent rounds — rolling summaries only
- Do not alter scorer or summarizer prompts without explicit instruction
- Do not return raw dicts from engine functions
- Do not add a database — JSON file storage only
- Do not build a CLI entrypoint — React UI + backend API only
- Do not use `print()` for logging

## Current Plan

v3 (Slack-style chatroom debate view) — **complete**. All deliverables shipped.  
Active plan: see `PLAN.md` at the repo root.

## Session discipline

Claude updates `### Current Session State` automatically after:
- finishing any file edit
- being asked "what have you done?"
- any /compact is about to run

## Current Session State

### Branch: `PLAN_v4.1` — last updated 2026-06-09 — v4.1.1 COMPLETE

### Files changed this session (not yet committed)

**Task 2 — CORS hardening**
- `backend/config.py` — added `allowed_origins: str = os.getenv("ALLOWED_ORIGINS", "*")`
- `backend/api/app.py` — replaced hardcoded `["*"]` with `_origins`; `allow_credentials=_origins != ["*"]`

**Task 3 — Component folder reorganisation (`tsc --noEmit` + `npm run build` pass)**
- All 57 `.tsx` files moved into 7 subdirs via `git mv`: `layout/`, `compose/`, `debate/`, `session/`, `drawers/`, `primitives/`, `team/`
- All 7 barrel `index.ts` files updated to `./ComponentName` paths
- `drawers/index.ts` — added `TemplateDrawer`; `team/index.ts` — added `TemplateNameChip`, removed `TemplateDrawer`
- `frontend/src/App.tsx` and `frontend/src/hooks/usePanelState.ts` — import paths updated

**Task 5 — `expertiseTag` removed**
- `frontend/src/data/experts.ts` — removed from `TeamMember` type, `FaceOption` type, all 16 `FACE_OPTIONS` entries, `mkMember` function
- `frontend/src/lib/consultHelpers.ts` — removed from `buildRunSignature`
- `frontend/src/components/team/AgentStripCards.tsx` — removed subtitle line
- `frontend/src/components/team/TeamMemberCard.tsx` — removed from face-change spread
- `frontend/src/components/team/TeamMemberEditForm.tsx` — removed from face-change spread

**Task 4 — Mobile logout verified accessible**
- Sidebar panel (with `admin@localhost` + logout →) is visible on mobile; no TopNav change needed
- Mobile layout restyling noted as v4.3 in `PLAN.md`

**PLAN.md updated**
- v4.1.1 marked Complete; v4.2 set as Active; v4.3 (Mobile UX) added

### Key decisions
- Task 1 already done: `sessions.py` uses `current_active_user` — stricter than plan asked for, no change needed.
- `allow_credentials=_origins != ["*"]` auto-resolves: credentials disabled in local dev, enabled in prod when `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` is set in Railway.
- `expertiseTag` was shown in `AgentStripCards` but the field added no value over `funFact` — removed entirely.

### Next steps
- Commit all v4.1.1 changes
- Set `ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://your-frontend.up.railway.app` in Railway backend Variables once frontend URL is known
- Start v4.2 (Public sharing)
