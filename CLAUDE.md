## Project Overview
MultiAi is a SaaS web app providing a multi-LLM consensus dashboard — better answers through structured AI agent collaboration. Users view, manage, and interact with a live debate between AI agents. Authentication is not yet implemented.

The debate UX is a **Slack-style chatroom** (`ChatroomDebateView`). Each agent has a distinct avatar and name; they post messages into a single scrollable feed as the debate progresses. Round boundaries appear as channel dividers. The Scorer posts like a status-update bot. Typing indicators appear between messages. The final answer is pinned at the top of the channel — permanently visible. This layout scales naturally to any number of team members.

## Commands

Run all commands from the project root (`MultiAi`).

### Backend
```bash
uv run uvicorn backend.api.app:app --reload --port 8000
```

### Frontend
```bash
cd frontend && npm install
npm run dev        # Dev server at http://localhost:5173
npm run build      # tsc + vite build
npm test           # vitest run
```

### Python Tests
```bash
uv run pytest tests/                          # All tests
uv run pytest tests/test_scorer.py            # Single test file
uv run pytest tests/test_scorer.py::test_name # Single test
```

### uv setup (first time only)
```bash
winget install astral-sh.uv   # install uv (PowerShell)
uv pip install -r backend/requirements.txt  # install Python deps into .venv
```
Note: Python deps are in `backend/requirements.txt` (no version pins). There is no `pyproject.toml`. Use `uv pip install -r` rather than `uv sync`.

## Architecture

MultiAi is a multi-LLM consensus engine. 
The user poses a question; 
a Writer LLM answers it, two Critic LLMs critique it, and the loop continues until a Scorer (always Deepseek v3.2) rates agreement ≥ the configured threshold or max rounds is reached. 
A Summarizer (always Deepseek v3.2) compresses each round into a rolling context used in subsequent rounds. All LLM calls go through OpenRouter.

### Debate loop flow

```
POST /api/consult-stream
  → Attachments normalized (text extracted; images checked — Deepseek seats swapped to Gemini Flash if image input detected)
  → Intent assessed — returns clarification state if question is too ambiguous
  → ConsensusEngine.run()
    → Round 1: Writer(s) answer fresh (parallel if N writers)
    → Loop:
        Critics critique in parallel (use rolling_context, not full transcript)
        Scorer rates 1–10 (Deepseek v3.2 only, 600-char excerpts)
        Summarizer compresses round → appended to rolling_context (Deepseek v3.2, max_tokens=200)
        If score >= threshold → break
        Writer refines answer
        Relevance validation: refined answer checked against original question
    → Writer synthesizes final answer
  → Session saved as sessions/YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json
```

### Context management rule (critical)
Rolling context is **append-only summaries**, never full transcripts:
```python
rolling_context += f"\n[Round {round_num} summary]: {round_summary}"
```
This string — not the full answer/critique text — is passed to LLMs in subsequent rounds.

### Model routing
- Writers and Critics: user-selected from UI (N writers and N critics supported — see below)
- Scorer: always `deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.2`
- Summarizer: always `deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.2`
- Never route scorer/summarizer to user-selected models

### N-writer / N-critic support (implemented)
The engine accepts `writers: list[str]` and `critics: list[str]` (1–6 each). Behavior:
- **N writers:** All draft in parallel in round 1; their answers are merged and labeled `[Writer 1]`, `[Writer 2]`, etc. The primary writer (first) handles all refinements and final synthesis.
- **N critics:** All critique in parallel every round. Critiques are merged and labeled. Consensus score is the average of all pairwise scores across critics' revised answers. Single-critic sessions compare the writer's answer directly against the critic's suggestion.
- **Frontend:** `mergeTeamIntoPayload` sends `writers` and `critics` as full lists. Legacy `writer`/`critic_a`/`critic_b` fields are also sent for backward compat; the backend prefers the list fields.
- **Cap:** max 6 writers, max 6 critics (enforced in `schemas.py`).

## Coding standards

**Python**
- Python 3.11+: type hints on all function signatures, dataclasses for models
- All constants and limits defined in `config.py` — no magic numbers
- All file paths use `pathlib.Path`
- `ConsensusEngine` takes `config` as constructor arg — no `os.environ` inside methods
- Session store functions are stateless — accept `sessions_dir` as parameter
- LLM clients are module-level singletons (lazy init) — the only allowed global state
- Return `DebateSession` or `DebateRound` from engine functions — never raw dicts
- Logging via `logging` module only (never `print()`): INFO for completions, WARNING for parse failures/budget exceeded, ERROR for API/IO failures

**Frontend**
- **Tailwind CSS v4** — uses `@import "tailwindcss"`, `@theme inline`, `@variant dark`. Not v3. Do not follow v3 config docs.
- **Routing: React Router v6** (`react-router-dom`). Routes: `/app/new` (empty compose), `/app/run/:id` (session view), `/shared/:slug` (public stub, v4.2). Navigate with `useNavigate`. Read URL params with `useParams`. Do not add SSR, file-based routing, or a second router without instruction.
- **No global state library** — state is held in custom hooks called from `App.tsx`. Do not add Redux, Zustand, Jotai, etc. without explicit instruction.
- Path alias `@` → `frontend/src/` (configured in both `vite.config.ts` and `tsconfig.json` — keep in sync if changed).
- Dark mode is class-based: `.dark` toggled on `<html>` by `useDarkMode` hook.

## Prompt templates

Do not modify scorer, summarizer, or debate prompt templates without explicit instruction — wording changes affect consensus behavior. Templates live in `backend/consensus/prompts.py`.

## Testing

- All tests mock LLM calls — never make live API calls in tests
- Use `pytest-mock` and `tmp_path` fixture for session storage tests
- Token budget: warn if any session exceeds 12,000 tokens total

## Token budget

| Call | Target |
|------|--------|
| Round 1 answer / critique / refinement / synthesis | ≤ 800 tokens each |
| Summarizer | ≤ 200 tokens (`max_tokens=200` enforced) |
| Scorer | ≤ 100 tokens (600-char excerpts only) |

## Environment variables

All secrets in `.env` (gitignored):
```
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=
OPENROUTER_BASE_URL=https://openrouter.ai/api/v1
DEFAULT_WRITER_MODEL=openai/gpt-5.4
DEFAULT_CRITIC_MODEL_A=anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.6
DEFAULT_CRITIC_MODEL_B=google/gemini-3.1-pro
SCORER_MODEL=deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.2
SUMMARIZER_MODEL=deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.2
```

## What NOT to do

- Do not pass full round transcripts to subsequent rounds — rolling summaries only
- Do not alter scorer or summarizer prompts without explicit instruction
- Do not return raw dicts from engine functions
- Do not add a database — JSON file storage only
- Do not build a CLI entrypoint — React UI + backend API only
- Do not use `print()` for logging

## Session discipline

Claude updates `### Current Session State` automatically after:
- finishing any file edit
- being asked "what have you done?"
- any /compact is about to run

## Current Session State

### Branch: `PLAN_v4.1` — last session 2026-06-09

### Files changed this session

**ChatroomDebateView 7-point polish**
- `frontend/src/components/RoundDivider.tsx` — rewritten: violet pill "Round X of Y" matching Directors Cut; `maxRounds` prop
- `frontend/src/components/ScoreBadge.tsx` — rewritten: coloured card (green ▲ improved / amber = flat / red ▼ dropped) with score chip
- `frontend/src/components/ChatMessage.tsx` — rewritten: `sublabel` prop (seat · professional title), `modelLabel` removed (icon badge tooltip only); typing animation removed; `isNew` fade-in kept
- `frontend/src/components/ChatroomDebateView.tsx` — rewritten: `resolvePerson()` uses active template for professional role titles (not expertiseTag); `teamTemplateName` threaded to `ChannelHeader`; `maxRounds` to `RoundDivider`
- `frontend/src/components/ChannelHeader.tsx` — rewritten: `Users` icon (violet); shows `teamTemplateName` directly (e.g. "Tourist Planner Team") + correct Lucide icon per template; fallback "Team Debate"
- `frontend/src/components/ChatPanel.tsx` — sublabels in Directors Cut now use template professional titles from role string (before " — "); removed `TemplateNameChip` from Director's Cut `titleEnd`; removed `FACE_OPTIONS`/`TemplateNameChip` imports; added `TEAM_TEMPLATES`

**Template chip — placement decisions**
- `frontend/src/components/TemplateNameChip.tsx` — **new file**: shared chip with icon + name; portal tooltip matching New Run page (template description + member list with Writer/Critic badges + professional titles)
- **Chip appears ONLY** in the "Viewing Saved Answer" banner (right side, next to action buttons) — removed from Question `titleEnd`, Final Answer header, Director's Cut `titleEnd`
- `frontend/src/components/SessionPromptBlock.tsx` — chip moved to right of banner; removed from Question `titleEnd`
- `frontend/src/components/PinnedAnswer.tsx` — chip removed; `TemplateNameChip` import removed

**Template context restoration (saved sessions)**
- `frontend/src/App.tsx` — added `inferredTemplateId`: matches saved session's `writer_names`/`critic_names` against `TEAM_TEMPLATES` to recover template when `activeTemplateId` is null. `resolvedTemplateId = activeTemplateId ?? inferredTemplateId` used everywhere
- `startNewQuestionWithSessionTeam` — now also calls `setActiveTemplateId(resolvedTemplateId)` so the template badge and team carry over to "+ New Question" and follow-up runs
- TopNav `onNewRun` changed from `startNewQuestion` → `startNewQuestionWithSessionTeam` so "+ New Run" preserves the current session's team instead of defaulting to John/Christy/Mark

### Key decisions made this session
- **`expertiseTag` on `FACE_OPTIONS` is deprecated for sublabels**: professional titles are now extracted from the template `role` string (split on `" — "`) rather than using the fun-fact tags ("Dawn Wave Chaser", "Midnight Hoops Hero" etc.). `FACE_OPTIONS.expertiseTag` still exists in the data but is no longer read by any component.
- **Single chip location**: template chip appears only once per view (top-right of "Viewing Saved Answer" banner). Showing it in 3–4 panel headers simultaneously was visually noisy.
- **Template inference from cast**: when loading a saved session, template is inferred by exact writer+critic name match against TEAM_TEMPLATES. If a member was customised (non-template team), no chip/title shows — correct behaviour.
- **`+ New Run` preserves team**: always carries over the current session's team/template. No "reset to default team" on nav — users change team intentionally via the CommandBar editor.

### Next steps / open items
- **v4.2**: Public shared run page (`/shared/:slug`) — stub exists, needs backend `GET /api/sessions/{id}/share` and share link UI
- **v4.3**: Settings drawer — account (change password), app defaults (models, rounds, threshold), appearance. Gear icon placeholder already in sidebar footer
- **Component file moves**: Barrel index files created but physical files still flat in `components/`. A follow-up session can move files into subdirectories (update ~50 import paths) — TypeScript will catch any misses
- **Mobile logout**: Logout is in sidebar footer; on mobile the sidebar collapses — confirm reachability or add logout to mobile-specific nav
- **`expertiseTag` cleanup**: `FACE_OPTIONS.expertiseTag` is now unused. Can either repurpose (e.g. a fun one-liner shown on hover in member cards) or remove the field entirely in a future pass.
